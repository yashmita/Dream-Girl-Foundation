<p>Indian law now requires companies to give 2% of their profits to charity. After all, a bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog. So, a corporate can donate either with a bitter feeling that they are being forced or with open arms, as an opportunity to make a difference. Dream Girl Foundation has made charity easier than ever. A corporate can partner with Dream Girl Foundation and in turn help needy children by using one (or more) of the following partnerships</p>

        <h1>Partnership for Non-Formal Education centers</h1>
        <p>World’s literacy rate at 86% (with some countries with 100%) dwarfs India’s literacy at a meager 74%. Poor literacy is one of the biggest factors thwarting the growth of India. We believe that an investment in knowledge pays the biggest interest. So, Dream Girl Foundation sets up Non-formal education centers in backward areas where children don’t have access or don’t attend schools. Dream Girl Foundation provides free of cost state of the art education to children who can’t afford schools. Our philosophy is Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. Don’t feel like you are too small to make.a change anymore and enroll with our NFE Partnership program because in learning one teaches and in teaching one learns. Cost of operating one NFE center is 9 lakh Rupees. A corporate can sponsor one or more NFE centers. It is up to the corporate to sponsor NFEs in nearby areas or far away areas. Details of all the children helped by the sponsored NFE center(s) will be shared with the corporate.</p>

You can get the same feeling as thousands of our donors’, by enrolling to our partnership for health projects. Dream Girl Foundation firmly believes that the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient. Dream Girl Foundation has so far helped hundreds of children with cancer, tumor and other lethal medical conditions. We don’t only provide financial support, but also give moral support to the family of patient. We believe that we only have what we give. Corporates can enroll to this partnership in one (or more) of the following 3 ways:

        1.  Establishing fund: A corporate can establish fund and as many people as the fund allows will be treated. Details and genuine discharge summary of all the patients will be  given to corporate on annual basis.
        2.  Area-wise treatment: Corporate can choose to fund just the patients of a particular region.
        3.  Disease wise treatment: Corporate can choose to fund patients of just a set of diseases. Corporate can choose the disease whose patients’ treatment will be funded.</p>
